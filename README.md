# Lacunes-Identification

The identification of lacunar infarcts is of great significance in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanism of Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). 

This paper proposes a semi-automated 3D multi-scale residual convolutional network (3D ResNet) for lacunar infarcts detection.
